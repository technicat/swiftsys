# SwiftSys

In-progress, this is a hodgepodge of code from my apps (mostly [Talk Dim Sum](http://talkdimsum.com/)) that I want to open source and reuse, including

- displaying and speaking Chinese words (Cantonese, Mandarin, and Mandarin with simplified characters)
- map display and info links of places collected by region and country (used for restaurants in Talk Dim Sum but could be anything)
- misc stuff

Formatted with [Swimat](https://github.com/Jintin/Swimat).

Linted with [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).

Should follow [Swift API guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).

Not a great name, but SwiftTalkChinese for example seemed too unwieldy. Will revisit.
