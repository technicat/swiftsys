# SwiftSys

In-progress, this is a hodgepodge of code from my [Talk Dim Sum](http://talkdimsum.com/) app that I want to open source, so it's a hodgepodge:

- displaying and speaking Chinese words (Cantonese, Mandarin, and Mandarin with simplified characters)
- map display and info links of places collected by region and country (used for restaurants in Talk Dim Sum but could be anything)
- misc stuff
