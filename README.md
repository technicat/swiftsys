# SwiftSys

In-progress, this is a hodgepodge of code from my Talk Dim Sum app that I want to open source, so it's a mix of fairly general stuff plus for code for learning Chinese and listing restaurants. Probably should have a different name, maybe split into separate packages (language, map, system..)
